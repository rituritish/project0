    <p>

There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

   <h1> Tips for prevention</h1>
   <p>
Follow the guidelines to help protect yourself from catching, carrying and passing on SARS-CoV-2.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash your hands frequently and carefully
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything including your phone or laptop.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Avoid touching your face
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Coronavirus can live on hard surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like a doorknob.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid touching any part of your face or head including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails.

                <li>
                    Do not share personal items like phones, makeup, or combs. It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws.

                </li>
                    <li>
                        It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Clean and disinfect surfaces
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                   
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Take social distancing seriously
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Social distancing means staying home and working remotely when possible. If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are carrying corona virus, it will be found in high amounts in your spit               </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Wear a (homemade) mask
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendsTrusted Source that almost everyone wear a cloth face mask in public settings where social distancing may be difficult
                </li>
                <li>
                    When used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or undiagnosed from transmitting covid-19 when they breathe, talk, sneeze, or cough. This, in turn, slows the spread of the virus.
